## Known Issues
- The editing experience in the configuration area is not the same as it is in the tracks area. => this needs to be aligned.
- Undo deleted tracks only works correctly when user is online.
- The auto-complete tag selection for tracks sometimes causes the page to become unusable.
  This is caused by known issue in the auto-complete component of angular-material
  (https://github.com/angular/material/issues/3287). Although this specific issue seems to be closed
  some users confirm that the issue is still around.
- tracks.ctrl.js is way overloaded.
